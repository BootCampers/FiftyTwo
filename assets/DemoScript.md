# Public Demo Transcript

Ankit: Hi, I am Ankit! I am part of the Codepath 2016 remote class!

Amit: Hello, I am Amit! I am part of the Codepath 2016 remote class as well!

Ankit: Together, we thank you for giving us the opportunity to present the app we've been building for the last few weeks.

Amit: There are a lot of places, and moments, we want to spend time playing cards with our friends and family, like flights, trains, airports, coffee shops, college campus, the list doesn't end.
But often, we don't get to play, limited by the constraints of physical space, deck of cards and a number of other reasons. 52 comes to the rescue.

Ankit: We're proud to present to you **'52'**. 52 is a simple yet powerful app which can be used to play card games with friends and family.
The app gives you a platform, works as a facilitator, and helps you play any cards game you like - **anytime, anywhere**.

Amit: The idea of the app is quite simple. It helps you create a game session and invite others to join.
You choose the virtual cards to play with, so that you won't need the physical cards any more.
You and the group decide the game to play for the round. 52 helps you set up a few rules, but doesn't limit with rules of a particular game.
Once in the game, 52 helps with
   * dealing cards,
   * seeing and exchanging them,
   * showing them to other players,
   * syncing game events and statuses across players' screens,
   * maintaining scores
   * and a lot of other cool things.

Ankit: Let's see the app in action.
Device on right is mine and on the left is Amit's.
I am going to register to 52 with my facebook account, 52 will use my facebook profile name and image throughout the game.

Amit: I am **NOT** going to use facebook login, will enter my username, select a fun avatar from the app and register.

Ankit: I am ready to start a new game!
* 52 will generate a unique game number for this session. I will share with game number to invite others.
* Now, I will select the cards to play with. 52 selects the default deck already. I can select/de-select them, add jokers or more decks as necessary. For now, Let's go with the default 52 cards and start the game.
* Yay! I am in the game.
* I am going to share this game number with Amit by clicking on the share icon at the top right corner.

Amit: Thanks Ankit for inviting me to the game! I will enter the game number you shared and join.

Ankit:
* Great! Amit has joined and I can see him in the game with his name and avatar.
* On his profile icon, I can see his current score on top right and the number of cards in his hands just below it.
* I can move the players around and place them anywhere I like.

Amit: At this point I can also see all the players who have joined already. Looks like we are all set! Let's go for it, Ankit!

Ankit: I am going to deal cards now.
* the app defaults the number of cards to deal based on the cards available and number of players. I want to deal 12 cards to each player, so I am going to change it.
* After dealing is done, I choose to move the remaining cards to table so that everyone can use them.
* I am choosing to shuffle the cards before dealing
* I am also playing in this round, so I choose to deal to myself as well
* As a rule, I am not going to let players to see cards on the table.
* All options done, now deal!!! 52 is syncing cards across devices now.

Amit:
* Wow! I got my cards and see them at the bottom in a nice circular stack.
* I can see the cards on table as well.
* Let's flip my cards. That's nice! Not a bad hand after all!
* Now let's peek through the cards on the table. Oops, I guess that' not allowed!

Ankit:
* I am done dealing, switching to the player window to start playing.
* There is a chat and game events option as well where I can see everything happening in the game.
* I can also send a message to other players. Let's say hi to all!

Amit:
* Hey, I don't need this card, let me drop this one to the sink!
* Let's move one of my card to the table.
* I see that my actions update other players' screen as well. Ankit could see I added a card to the table.

Ankit: Amit, you put a card on the table, I need it. I'll pick it up.

Amit:
* Ankit, I need to call pass for this round. 52 is asking me to confirm, since I won't be able to play in this round anymore.
* I muted myself. Now I want to show my cards to everyone. 52 is again asking me to confirm.

Ankit:
* Amit is showing his cards. Let's flip them.
* This round is done. Let's go the dealer window and end this round.
* Let's record everyone's score. [Score 1 to Amit, 3 to Ankit]

Amit:
* Congrats Ankit for winning this round!

Ankit:
* Amit, we can play the next round or even play another game in the same session. We don't have to leave the game.

Amit:
* I really need to leave now. Nathan asked to limit this presentation to 60 seconds and we are at 61 already!

Ankit:
* I can see Amit leaving from the game as his icon disappeared. I can still continue for a few more rounds, but this needs to end!
* That concludes our demo for today.

Amit:
* We'd like to share with you some of the features we'd like to build in near future:

Ankit:
* We plan to publish the app in Google Play Store
* We also plan to build 52 app across platforms such as IOS, Daydream VR, Oculus Rift so that the players can have a fun and wholesome experience!
* We aim to support different types of cards, such as UNO cards, WWE flash cards etc.
* We plan to build sophisticated game rules support to provide a smooth user experience.

Amit: Last but not the least, thank you Nathan, our TAs and the entire codepath team for your support.

Ankit: Thank you.
